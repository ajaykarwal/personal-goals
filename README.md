# Personal goals

> This is my public facing personal goals and tasks repository, inspired by [@una](https://github.com/una/personal-goals). The idea is to be transparent about certain goals to encourage me to complete them and be accountable if I don't.
>
> To make things more achievable I'm going to limits the goals to 5 per month for now. I'll increase this number as I pick up momentum.
>
> I also have some long term goals for the year which have no timescale or priority. They're just things which I would like to achieve at some point.

**What if I don't complete a goal?**

I'll carry any incomplete goals to the following cycle which will of course make me accountable for more next time. This won't be sustainable for too long so it should get my ass into gear!
