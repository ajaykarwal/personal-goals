# Personal goals

> This is my public facing personal goals and tasks repository, inspired by [@una](https://github.com/una/personal-goals). The idea is to be transparent about certain goals to encourage me to complete them and be accountable if I don't.
>
> Most of these are long term goals for the year which have no timescale or priority. They're just things which I would like to achieve at some point.

### What if I don't complete a goal?

A little encouragement goes a long way :smile:
